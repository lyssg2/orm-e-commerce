## Description

By using Insomnia, a user can easily guide through the company's database to look through categories, products and tags, all of which were associated to the other through models and routes using Sequelize. Within Insomnia, a user can 
1. View all (or one) product(s), categorie(s) and tag(s) through GET requests
2. Create a new product, category or tag through CREATE requests
3. Update an existing product, category or tag through UPDATE requests
4. Delete an existing product, category or tag through DELETE requests
